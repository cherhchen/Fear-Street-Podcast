        Hello and welcome to <i>The Devil on Fear Street</i>. I’m your host, Cheryl Chen. And today, we will be discussing Leigh Janiak’s 2021 horror film trilogy, <i>Fear Street</i>. More specifically, we will be delving into how the films tie into the historical depictions of devil figures and the ways in which the films serve as a mirror to our harsh reality that is laden with persecution, oppression, and exploitation of marginalized communities.

      <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        So, the <i>Fear Street</i> trilogy was released on Netflix in the summer of 2021, and each film delves into a different time period and story. Nonetheless, they are all connected and all serve a purpose. The first film, <i>1994</i>, depicts our “present day” and introduces us to the town of Sunnyvale—a prosperous place deemed the safest town in America—and its evil neighbor, Shadyside, also known as Killer Capital USA—a town plagued with a history of horrific murders and a fabled “witch’s curse”. The second film, <i>1978</i>, gives us a deeper insight into the horrors and traumas that Shadyside and its residents have experienced in the past. And, finally, the third film, <i>1666</i>, reveals the origins of the so-called “witch’s curse”, the reasons why ordinary people turn into serial killers overnight, and why Shadysiders seem to be stuck in this never ending cycle of violence.
      </p>
      <p class=spacer></p>

      <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        If the names of these two towns weren’t enough to tell the differences between them, the scenes in <i>Fear Street 1994</i> paints us a comprehensive picture of the disparity in social status and wealth between Shadyside and Sunnyvale. Scenes of Sunnyvale depict gaudy mansions built with marble, Greek Revival style architecture, and luscious green lawns. Meanwhile, Shadyside features shoddy one-story houses, dilapidated buildings and roads, and an underfunded high school with metal detectors erected at the entrance. There is also a discernible difference between the residents as Shadysiders are mostly people of color while Sunnyvalers are mostly white. Perhaps the most defining feature of Shadyside residents is their demoralizing, hopeless attitude. Every Shadysider exhibits desires of wanting to get out of Shadyside and break away from this cycle of poverty, especially our teenage characters, but at the same time, they know the odds are heavily stacked against them. I think Ziggy in <i>1978</i> perfectly encapsulates this sentiment with this remark: [“No one gets out of this town, not even Miss Perfect. Bet on your way out, you get run over by a bus.”]

      <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        When we finally find out why Shadyside has all these killings throughout their history, it becomes perfectly clear why Shadyside residents are seemingly trapped in their dreadful situations. In the last movie of the trilogy, we find out that Sunnyvale’s sheriff, Nick Goode, and his ancestors had been responsible for the horrific murders in Shadyside all along. Each generation of Goode men periodically makes a deal with the Devil that turns Shadyside residents into possessed serial killers. In exchange for the blood of Shadysiders, the Devil grants Goode whatever he wishes for including wealth, power, and social status. Although there is a devil entity present in the films, it becomes apparent that Goode is the actual representation of the devil figure. He masks himself as the “good guy” (pun not intended), saying he wants to help you or that he believes you. [Goode: “Well, if you do think of anything, give me a call. I’m on your side. Deena: “Yeah, totally.”] But really this is all just part of a well-crafted mask. Aligning with devil conventions, he is a manipulator, not just of people but of perceptions.

      <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        This is where we see the intertwining of exploitation and persecution. Not only did Goode sacrifice Shadysiders for his own benefit, he uses his position of power to play into this narrative that these murders happen because there is something inherently wrong with Shadysiders. That they just “snap”. That it’s <i>their</i> fault that they are poor and their crime rate is high, which is a sentiment far too familiar in our current political landscape. After Kate and Simon were labeled as “junkies” and blamed for the spree of killings in <i>1994</i>, Deena says to Goode, [“Another Shadyside tragedy. An underprivileged overachiever with bright prospects. A guy who’s been supporting his family alone since he was 15. Both succumb to the quick cash of drugs. Fits the narrative, right? Nice and neat.”]

      <!-- Paragraph 6 -->
      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        With Sarah Fier’s story in <i>1666</i>, we see another layer of persecution. She is demonized as a “witch” and accused of “lying with the Devil”, which is essentially subtext for her intimate relationship with the pastor’s daughter. Through this manufactured tale, she becomes the ultimate scapegoat for centuries of the Goode family’s misdeeds. Here, the Devil is used to justify the persecution of Sarah Fier and push a narrative that her love for a woman is evil and wicked. It becomes clear that the act of breaking away from established norms, in this case heteronormativity, could be seen by society as an act related to the Devil.

      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        Either in <i>Fear Street</i> or in our world, throughout history, we have seen the Devil used as a means of control. A tool for manipulating perceptions and instilling fear and anxiety. A tool for turning the public against specific groups of people. For example, in the Middle Ages, depictions of Satan featured a hook nose to play into antisemitic stereotypes. Other depictions in European folklore describe Satan as a Black man. Even connecting situations to the Devil may achieve the same purpose. Some say that homosexuality is a sin or a disease that is inflicted by the Devil. When people thought daycare centers were a hub for Satanic rituals in the 1980s, some people attributed this “crisis” to more women getting jobs and gaining more independence from their traditional homemaker roles
      </p>
      <p class=spacer></p>

      <!-- Paragraph 7 -->
      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        I think, in more modern times, there is less blatant Devil finger-pointing, like “Oh that person is the Devil or in cahoots with the Devil”. Demonization has evolved into the more subtle form of criminalization. I think a good example of this is what Donald Trump said in his Presidential Campaign Announcement Speech about Mexican immigrants. [“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs, They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some I assume are good people, but I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we’re getting, and it only makes common sense.”] To me, to hear a former president say this is kind of jarring. He wants stricter immigration laws. Okay. But to achieve his political agenda, he pushes this narrative that Mexican immigrants are criminals and, in a way, manipulates his constituents into a very closed-minded, fear-driven mentality. That it’s us versus them. It’s good versus evil. And all this culminates into the dissemination of racist ideals and stereotypes that leads to further discrimination of certain communities.

      <!-- Paragraph 8 -->
      <p class = "lh-lg mx-5 px-5">
        Circling back to <i>Fear Street</i>, we see both the subtle and not-so-subtle ways the Devil and demonization is used to discriminate against people for the benefit of the corrupted. Sarah Fier, a queer woman, is hanged for “lying with the Devil”. Shadysiders, a poor working class community, are painted as criminals, serial killers, and people undeserving of compassion. But once Deena uncovers the truth behind Goode and his dealings, the Shadyside residents attempt to take back control of their narrative. Thus, taking back their own power. [Deena: “Everyone says Shadyside sucks because it’s full of shitty people, that bad things happen here because we’re bad, that we deserve what we have coming. That’s how it was for Sarah and that’s how it’s been for us. But it’s all bullshit. Okay, just because we’re weird and smart and different doesn’t mean they can feed us through their meat grinder. Not anymore. It’s been three centuries. No one else has gotten this far. It stops here. Tonight. It stops with us.”] By stabbing Nick Goode in the eye and exposing the truth to the public at the end, Deena breaks the vicious cycle of violence and exploitation inflicted upon Shadyside residents for centuries. While fixing our reality won’t be nearly as easy, the act of uncovering the truth and making that truth known is one step closer to holding corrupted people in power accountable for their actions and abolishing discriminatory practices that demonize marginalized communities.
